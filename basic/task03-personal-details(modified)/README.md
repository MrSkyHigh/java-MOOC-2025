Personal Details Program (Modified)

Original task from the course: 

Write a program that reads names and birth years from the user until an empty line is entered. The name and birth year are separated by a comma.
After that the program prints the longest name and the average of the birth years. If multiple names are equally long, you can print any of them. You can assume that the user enters at least one person.

My extension: 

I found the original task too simplistic to upload it to my GitHub. I extended it and added some new features, so now it asks and prints: 
name, sex, age, height, weight, eye color, number of tattoos, marital status.

It also calculates and displays:

BMI (Body Mass Index) for each person. 
Longest name.
Oldest and youngest person.
Average age.
Average BMI.
List of people without tattoos. 

The program was made using fundamental Java features, showing how even simple tools can be used to produce structured and useful output.

How to Run:

1.Open your terminal (cmd).

2.Compile the file:
javac PersonalInfo.java

3.Run the program:
java PersonalInfo
