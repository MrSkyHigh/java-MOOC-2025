I've decided to write a small program that would summarize what I learned in the 4th part of the Java 1 course. 
There are 4 files containing various books for sale. 
Each file is written in the following format: name, wrtiter, publication year, pages, price.

The program asks the user which genre of books they would like to see. 
After the user enters the name of the needed file, the program reads the it. Then the books from the given file are added to an ArrayLists of Book objects. 
Then the user is asked again to choose a book they'd like to buy.  
Chosen books, their prices, and the total price are shown on the screen at the end. 

With this exercise I wanted to practice: using lists, reading files, basic OOP, primitive user interaction, loops and arrays.   

How to Run:

1. Copy all the files to the preffered folder. 
2. Open your command prompt and enter the exact path to that folder.
3. Compile Book and MiniBookstore by entering javac Book.java MiniBookstore.java
4. Use java MiniBookstore to run the program.
