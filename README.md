# java-MOOC-2025
My programming practice and solutions for Java 1 and 2 courses from the University of Helsinki MOOC

I will keep adding more solutions and new things I've learned, as I'm studying basic Java programming skills with these free courses from the University of Helsinki (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

The tools I'm currently using throughout the courses: 

OpenjDK11

TMCBeans 1.5.0 (from MOOC)

GitHub

I use knowledge from these courses to practice writing my own code. These are my first steps in Java, basically. 
My progress is pretty slow, but better take your time and understand things deeper rather than go rapidly, not really knowing what you're doing. 

I base my code around the examlpes and practice tasks which are given in the courses. 

I write my code by myself. My comments are included inside each file for clarity. Task names are based on the original course, but the code is written by me, how I undesrtand it. 

Easier, simple programms will be in 'basic'

More complex programms will be in 'harder'

My personal projects that I have made up and written code for will be in 'projects'
