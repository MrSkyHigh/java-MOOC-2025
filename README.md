# java-MOOC-2025
My programming practice and solutions for Java 1 and 2 courses from the University of Helsinki MOOC (https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

I will keep adding more solutions and new things I've learned as I'm studying basic Java programming skills.

The tools I'm currently using throughout the courses: 

OpenjDK11

TMCBeans 1.5.0 (from MOOC)

GitHub

I use knowledge from these courses to practice writing my own code. These are my first steps in Java, basically. 
My progress is pretty slow, but better take your time and understand things deeply rather than rush, not really knowing what you're doing. 

I base my code on the examples and practice tasks which are provided by the courses. 

I write my code by myself. My comments about what a particular part of the code does are included inside each file for clarity. Task names are based on the original course, but the code is written by me, given my reflections on the material I've studied. 

Simpler programs will be in 'basic/'

More complex programs will be in 'harder/'

My personal projects that I have thought of and developed code for will be in 'projects/'
